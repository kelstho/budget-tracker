# Budget Tracker
![Site](/screenshots/budget.png?raw=true)
This application will keep track of the user's budget information based on user input. The user can add and subtract funds whether they are online or offline. Two input boxes at the top of the page allows users to enter new funds to be added or subtracted. The first input box allows the user to provide the name of the transaction, while the second box allows the user to provide the dollar amount. Buttons located just below the input boxes allow for the addition or subtraction of funds from the total amount.
![Graph](/screenshots/graph.png?raw=true)
A graph located at the bottom of the page changes to reflect changes in funds over time. The y-axis represents the amount of money in the account, the x-axis represents the amount of time during which those changes have taken place. This graph changes automatically based on user input.

*The The application itself was pre-developed by Triology; I developed the offline functionality by providing the web manifest and service worker.
